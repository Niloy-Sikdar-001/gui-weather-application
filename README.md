# gui-weather-application
Simple GUI Application for showing current weather status.

I am using "tkinter" package to build the GUI
Weather API from : https://openweathermap.org/api
Using "Python Imaging Library(PIL)" to show weather pictures
Using "requests" module to send https requests

Configure config.ini file with your own api key


If you don't have PIL installed , run "pip install Pillow" in terminal.
If you don't have "requests" installed , run "pip install requests" in terminal.
